How to run?


1.	Unzip zip files of dataset. You may find below files:
		data.json
		query0.json
		query1.json
		query2.json
		query3.json
		query4.json

2.	Copy the json files to folder "rawData"


3.	Run MultiQ_ED_NoBoost.py to search similar subsequences without low bound function (Distance = Euclidean Distance).
OR	Run MultiQ_ED_LowRes.py to search similar subsequences using low bound function (Distance = Euclidean Distance).


Extra:	You could visualize the raw data by _DataPloting.py
	You could generate random walk query by _QueryGenerator.py
	The excel spreadsheet files are full experiment results.
